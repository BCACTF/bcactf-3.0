  I've made a little website to access a SQL database.
  I even added a way to share your queries with other people! Just copy the link.
hints:
  - The contents of the database will give you some info on what to do next.
  - You can only change the query; can you inject arbitrary HTML with it?

deploy:
  web:
    build: .
    expose: 80/tcp
  admin:
    build: ./admin-bot/
    expose: 3000/tcp

# Implementation notes: Hide the fact that this is an XSS challenge (the SQL table says
# "submit link to admin bot at [LINK]" right now, placeholder should be changed).
# Not entirely sure how to get output from the bot, but I assume y'all will figure that out
# (the table also instructs solvers that "the flag is in the bot's "flag" cookie")
# also deploy /src
