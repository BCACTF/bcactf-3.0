  I'm learning JavaScript, and just created a calculator function! I didn't want to bother actually parsing the string bit-by-bit, though, and it's rather simple.
hints:
  - My calculator function uses eval().
  - You can use "[]+" to essentially cast something to a string.
  - To solve, you will need letters from "[object Object]" and "false".
