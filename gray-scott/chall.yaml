  My YouTube recommendations have been FLOODED with Gray-Scott videos recently.
  Sure, I watch a lot of videos of random simulations, but how many videos
  of "Gray-Scott Reaction-Diffusion (satisfying) #short" with 31 views 
  can I endure before I go insane? Anyways, here's an unrelated crypto problem.
hints:
  - The encryption operates independently on each bit of the bytes in plaintext.
  - The Gray-Scott system is a reaction-**diffusion** system.
