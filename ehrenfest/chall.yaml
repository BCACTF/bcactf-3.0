  I wrote this problem after Gray-Scott, and I wanted to keep the code the same,
  so it's all Gray-Scott themed. I bet you're wondering what Gray-Scott is, and 
  for that matter, what Ehrenfest is. I bet you're thinking I'll tell you. You're
  wrong. Look it up! Don't be lazy. Take control of your own future. Also, go read
  the Gray-Scott problem for context.

  - How can you use the given encoded messages to decode messages?
  - How much data is actually lost in this encoding?
