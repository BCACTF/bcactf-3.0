  Just a wonderful website! 
  It looks like the flag is right there!
  Or is it?
hints:
  - There's a lot of text covering the flag; you might want to get rid of that.
  - Trying all the possible combinations isn't the best way to go.
  - Notice how all of the paragraphs belong to a specific class.
