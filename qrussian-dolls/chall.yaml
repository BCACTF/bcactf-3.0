  My Russian nesting dolls seem to have hopped on the hype train of QR codes... a little bit after they were cool. Anyway, can you help retrieve the message they're trying to send me? (Do BCAPNG first!)
hints:
  - QR codes don't have to contain just text...
  - Make sure the flag format is followed.
  - Letters tend to be towards the lower right of the images.
