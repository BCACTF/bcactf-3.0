  I found the flag factory!!! They keep their flags locked up. But I have insider info that they only use 5 digit passwords. Can you get a flag?

  - Looks like a careless programmer left a debug link behind...
  - Hmmm, that's not the password you put in...
  - Don't bruteforce passwords on the website...
