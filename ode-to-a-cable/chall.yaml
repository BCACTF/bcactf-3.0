  I just spent a bunch of money on an amazing piano keyboard,
  but I didn't realize I can't connect it directly to my PC!
  I then spent a bunch more money on an audio interface,
  but there was this STUPID ANNOYING BUZZING SOUND whenever I recorded something.
  I then spent even more money on a cable to replace it (actually only $6.60, it was on sale!)
  and now there's barely any buzzing left!
  
  With this new equipment, I wrote a song to my friend in France.
  He doesn't speak English, but they say music is a universal language,
  so we jam together sometimes! Also, don't try to analyze the buzzing sound.
  It's genuinely not supposed to be there, and it's not a part of the problem.
  Actually, if you do know what's causing it, please DM me. I'm pretty desperate at this point.
  Anyways, I hope you like the song!
  
hints:
  - Seriously, the buzzing isn't part of the problem. Stop trying to analyze it.
  - I mean it, there's actually nothing to analyze with the buzzing.
  - STOP ANALYZING THE BUZZING
  - I really hope that saying about music being a universal language is true! Because I have no intention to learn French. 
  - Consider various ways of describing the music in hint.mp3...
