  This time, we support THREE colors! And we've reduced the file size by using raw binary.
  (Though, with caveats that it's hard to read with a text editor or edit manually, and that the maximum file size is 256x256.)
hints:
  - The resolution is now represented in just two bytes.
  - The pixels now require ternary to represent three colors.
  - Remember, the ternary's been converted to raw binary.
