hints:
  - Your IGUID is not used as an index into the hashmap. Only the result of the "proprietary algorithm" is used.
  - Although your IGUID is not used as an index into the hashmap... it is still stored as a vector of bytes in "used_keys".
  - How proprietary is this "proprietary algorithm", anyway?
