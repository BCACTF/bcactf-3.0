# Blender Creation (Foren/Misc, 150 points)
Opening the png file in a text/hex editor reveals Python code at the end of the file. The code imports the `bpy` library, which is Blender's library used to interact with objects in the editor using Python. Opening the Blender editor and going to the scripting tab, you can see a place to write Python code. Pasting in the code found at the end of the png file and running it recreates the scene from the image. You can then rotate the camera to reveal the flag. You can click on the textbox and enter Edit Mode (press tab) to be able to copy the flag.
