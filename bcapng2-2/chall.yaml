  I've been using .bcapng2 to store flags. I've even written a program to create the files in a consistent format.
  The issue is, my flag file is corrupted: three bytes turned into 0s!
  The only other thing I have is a test file that's supposed to say "QU1CKBR0WNFOX", generated by my program. It might be helpful as an example of the format.
  The corruption seems impossible to fix manually. Could you write a program to help me find and recover the flag?
hints:
  - Can you figure out some features of the "consistent format" the program uses?
  - Each character is 3 pixels wide by 5 pixels high, and they alternate in color between 2 and 1.
