  BCACTF's latest creation: an image file format! It can represent black and white pixels, and isn't too efficient.
  The problem is, someone sent me a .bcapng file and I lost the program to view it. Could you tell me what it is?
hints:
  - What do the first two numbers in the file represent?
  - bcapng files can only represent black or white pixels
