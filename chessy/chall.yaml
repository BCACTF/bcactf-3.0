  I've been learning a bit of chess recently.
  However, I can't seem to understand whatever this is.
  Can you help me?
hints:
  - Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) is a common method of describing a position in chess.
  - These positions don't seem like they'd actually be found in real games. Maybe there's something else to them?
