  I'm carefully drawing *a fine line* on this piece of paper, letting each portion guide the next...
  (Digits and letters are 0-9 and 10-35 in their usual orders, and the underscore is 36.
  {} are not encoded but should be added in afterwards. All letters are lowercase.)
hints:
  - This uses the affine cipher, as clued by the title and description.
  - What's a convenient way to represent affine cipher keys? Remember, the plaintext should start with "bcactf".
