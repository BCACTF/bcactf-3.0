# convert image to a matrix

# perform DCT on it
# use the quantization table on it
# Read the matrix from top left to bottom right order
# compress said file

# make a file containing the image and the quantization table

# give the problem solver a library to open the file type
# uncompress the file
# undo the quantization
# use inverse DCT
# convert back to an image
