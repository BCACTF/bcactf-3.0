  Just another heap notetaker challenge - compiled to wasm.
files:
# provided.wasm should be provided
# chall.wasm should be executed
  - src: provided.wasm
authors:

# TODO : Deployment
# Docker file needs to install something like wasmtime
# https://wasmtime.dev/

# DO NOT COMPILE UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY (it may possibly modify the solve / provided) : emcc src.c -s STANDALONE_WASM -o XX.wasm
# note: to create chall.wasm, modify provided.wasm so that sample flag is instead the actual flag
# wasmtime chall.wasm
