1. Open the msg.txt file
2. Observe that there are many characters repeated many times before going over to a new character
    - maybe there is something special about how many times they repeat?
3. Create a script to count how many of each letter there are or throw them into a character frequency analyzer (probably the former)
4. Notice that the counts of each variable corresponds to a certain ascii value
5. take the frequency of each char --> ascii and you get the flag
